<div>
  @for (monkey of monkeys; track monkey) {
    <span (mouseenter)="openEyes(monkey)" (mouseleave)="closeEyes(monkey)">{{ monkey.hasEyesOpen ? 'ğŸ™‰' : 'ğŸ™ˆ' }}</span>
  }
  <br />
  <button (click)="addMonkey()">Add monkey</button>
</div>

<!-- 1. Use event binding so that when clicking the button a new monkey is added -->
<!-- 2. Use event binding so that when hovering on a monkey its eyes open -->

<!-- TIP1: No need to change anything outside of this file except for the bonus -->
<!-- TIP2: Use the mouseenter event for opening the eyes on hovering -->

<!-- BONUS: Close the eyes of the monkey when not hovering anymore -->
